By then Hez could see for himself , and so could the others .
Soon they were all shouting greetings , exchanging smiles , and rejoicing to think that they were all back together again .
But even a reunion as joyous as this one did not make a break in the routines of the day .
Nor could they stop and find out about all that had happened until they made circle , tended the cattle , tethered the horses , gathered fuel , carried water , and started their cooking fires .
Then , and only then , with the Jacksons and Dan as their true guests of honor , did the Harrows take time to catch up on the news .
No sooner did they hear of Dan's injury than both Gran and Matilda went into immediate action .
The wound in his scalp was examined , pronounced healing , and well doctored with simples , before they dished up the victuals .
From then on , in keeping with the traditions they had followed since childhood , the whole group settled down to relish their food .
Even Sally , in spite of her gaiety and obvious welcome , followed the old taboo of `` quitting the gab when wearing the nosebag '' .
As autumn starts its annual sweep , few Americans and Canadians realize how fortunate they are in having the world's finest fall coloring .
Spectacular displays of this sort are relatively rare in the entire land surface of the earth .
The only other regions so blessed are the British Isles , western Europe , eastern China , southern Chile and parts of Japan , New Zealand and Tasmania .
Their autumn tints are all fairly low keyed compared with the fiery stabs of crimson , gold , purple , bronze , blue and vermilion that flame up in North America .
Jack Frost is not really responsible for this great seasonal spectacle ; ; in fact , a freezing autumn dulls the blaze .
The best effects come from a combination of temperate climate and plenty of late-summer rain , followed by sunny days and cool nights .
Foliage pilgrimages , either organized or individual , are becoming an autumn item for more and more Americans each year .
Below is a specific guide , keyed to the calendar .
By the time we arrived , the party was already going strong .
A couple of the girls were laughing rather shrilly and I realized they were drinking .
My folks wouldn't dream of having alcohol in the house , so my first taste of it had been -- of course -- with Johnnie .
I hadn't liked it at first -- it was bitter and burning .
But when Johnnie disguised the taste with ginger ale , I enjoyed it .
Of course I enjoyed 'most anything if I did it with Johnnie .
Johnnie I suddenly realized he'd been totally out of my thoughts all evening .
But that was only natural , I decided ; ; surely he was still resting snugly in my heart .
This further demonstration of O'Banion's ballooning power did not please Torrio and Capone .
In the past year there had been too many examples of his euphoric self-confidence and self-aggrandisement for their liking .
He behaved publicly with a cocky , swaggering truculence that offended their vulpine Latin minds , and behaved towards them personally with an unimpressed insolence that enraged them beneath their blandness .
They were disturbed by his idiotic bravado -- as , when his bodyguard , Yankee Schwartz , complained that he had been snubbed by Dave Miller , a prize-fight referee , chieftain of a Jewish gang and one of four brothers of tough reputation , who were Hirschey , a gambler-politician in loose beer-running league with Torrio and O'Banion , Frank , a policeman , and Max , the youngest .
To settle this slight , O'Banion went down to the La Salle Theatre in the Loop , where , he had learned , Dave Miller was attending the opening of a musical comedy .
At the end of the performance , Dave and Max came out into the brilliantly lit foyer among a surge of gowned and tuxedoed first nighters .
O'Banion drew his guns and fired at Dave , severely wounding him in the stomach .
A second bullet ricocheted off Max's belt buckle , leaving him unhurt but in some distress .
O'Banion tucked away his gun and walked out of the theatre ; ; he was neither prosecuted nor even arrested .
That sort of braggadocio , for that sort of reason , in the view of Torrio and Capone , was a nonsense .
Because the private eye intends to save society in spite of himself , he invariably finds himself in trouble with the police .
The latter are either too stupid to catch the killer or too corrupt to care .
In either case , they do not appreciate the private detective's zeal .
Perry Mason and Hamilton Burger , Nero Wolfe and Inspector Cramer spend more time fighting each other than they do in looking for the criminal .
Frequently enough , the police are themselves in league with the killer ; ; Dashiell Hammett's Red Harvest provides a classic example of this theme .
But even when the police are honest , they do not trust the private eye .
He is , like Phillip Marlowe , too alienated to be reliable .
Finally , in The Maltese Falcon among others , the clash between detective and police is carried to its logical conclusion : Sam Spade becomes the chief murder suspect .
In order to exonerate himself , he is compelled to find the real criminal , who happens to be his girl friend .
What was only a vague suspicion in the case of Sherlock Holmes now appears as a direct accusation : the private eye is in danger of turning into his opposite .
The easiest way to describe this release is to say that it reproduces an interesting and effective Steinberg performance with minimal alteration of its musical values .
The engineering as such never obtrudes upon your consciousness .
The effect of the recording is very open and natural , with the frequency emphasis exactly what you would expect from a live performance .
This absence of peaky highs and beefed-up bass not only produces greater fidelity , but it eliminates listener fatigue .
A contributing factor is the perspective , the uniform aesthetic distance which is maintained .
The orchestra is far enough away from you that you miss the bow scrapes , valve clicks , and other noises incidental to playing .
Yet you feel the orchestra is near at hand , and the individual instruments have the same firm presence associated with listening from a good seat in an acoustically perfect hall .
Command has achieved the ideal amount of reverberation .
The music is always allowed the living space needed to attain its full sonority ; ; yet the hall never intrudes as a quasi-performer .
The timbre remains that of the instruments unclouded by resonance .
Mrs. Holden turned from the window draperies .
`` They found something else up there '' , she said half-aloud to the empty room .
`` They took it away , overalls or something '' .
She walked restlessly across the room , then back to the windows .
`` Now they've gone , they didn't come back , and they didn't arrest that Dronk boy '' .
She stood frowning and chewing her lip .
She was wearing a brown cotton dress , cut across the hips in a way that was supposed to make her look slimmer , a yoke set into the skirt and flaring pleats below .
She smoothed the skirt , sat down , then stood up and went back to the windows .
`` Why on earth did I send him off to work ? ?
There was excuse enough to keep him home that young Mr. Arthur's still over there '' .
First of all , what is their evidence that the tactual apparatus was fundamentally undamaged ? ?
( 1 ) When an object was placed in the patient's hand , he had no difficulty determining whether it was warm or cold , sharp or blunt , rough or smooth , flexible , soft , or hard ; ; and he could tell , simply by the feel of it , whether it was made of wood , iron , cloth , rubber , and so on .
And he could recognize , by touch alone , articles which he had handled immediately before , even though they were altogether unfamiliar to him and could not be identified by him ; ; that is , he was unaware what kind of objects they were or what their use was .
( 2 ) The patient attained an astonishing efficiency in a new trade .
Because of his brain injury and the extreme damage suffered to his sight , the patient had to train himself for a new line of work , that of a portfolio-maker , an occupation requiring a great deal of precision in the making of measurements and a fairly well-developed sense of form and contour .
It seems clear , when one takes into consideration the exceedingly defective eyesight of the patient ( we shall describe it in detail in connection with our second question , the one concerning the psychical blindness of the patient ) , that he had to rely on his sense of touch much more than the usual portfolio-maker and that consequently that faculty was most probably more sensitive to shape and size than that of a person with normal vision .
And so the authors conclude : `` The conduct of the patient in his every-day life and in his work , even more than the foregoing facts ( mentioned above under 1 ) , leave positively no room for doubt that the sense of touch , in the ordinary sense of the word , was unaffected ; ; or , to put the same thing in physiological terms , that the performance-capacity of the tactual apparatus , from the periphery up to the tactual centers in the brain , -- that is , from one end to the other -- was unimpaired '' .
A high-speed shutter has been developed in order to permit photographic observation of any portion of the electrical wire explosion .
The shutter consists of two parts : a fast-opening part and a fast-closing part .
Using Edgerton's method , the fast-closing action is obtained from the blackening of a window by exploding a series of parallel lead wires .
The fast-opening of the shutter consists of a piece of aluminum foil ( approximately Af ) placed directly in front of the camera lens so that no light may pass into the camera .
The opening action is obtained when a capacitor , charged to high voltage , is suddenly discharged through the foil .
During the discharge the magnetic forces set up by the passage of current cause the edges of the foil to roll inward toward its center line , thus allowing light to pass into the camera .
Experiments have shown that the shutter is 75 percent open in about 60-80 microseconds .
The shutter aperture may be made larger or smaller by changing the foil area and adjusting the electrical energy input to the foil .
