But there must be a catalytic pressure .
The military in Taiwan believe that the Communists have made two mistakes , which , together , may prove fatal .
The first was the commune program , which will ensure agricultural poverty for years .
The family is largely broken up ; ; and where it is not , it is left with no residue , and the social meaning of this is enormous .
For it is the family that , in China , has always provided social security for the indigent , the sick , the down-and-out members of the clan .
Now the government must do that ; ; but the government is left with no reserve granary , under the agricultural system it has ordained .
Thus the government simultaneously undertook the vast burden of social security which had traditionally been privately discharged , and created a national scarcity which has engendered calamitous problems of social security .
It must be noticed in Fig.
7-1 that the accelerometer responds to any input acceleration .
The equation relating input acceleration to output platform angle is Af .
In practice , the preflight leveling process takes place with the system mounted in the airframe .
When the system is arranged for automatic leveling , the platform angles respond to any horizontal components of acceleration acting on the accelerometers .
There are many such components of acceleration present due to the effect of wind gusts , engine noise , turbulence around the vehicle , etc. . One of the greatest problems associated with automatic leveling is establishing a true level in the presence of high-level acceleration noise .
One solution to the problem is to operate with a low loop gain and to include low-pass filters .
This technique causes the system to respond only to low frequency acceleration components such as the platform tilt .
Since a lower loop gain and low-pass filtering increases the response time , a practical compromise must be reached .
To carry out this exalted conception the author has combined the vivid realism and imaginative power we have noticed in his early poetry and carried them out on a grand scale .
His peculiar gift , as had been suggested before , is his intensity .
George Meredith has said that fervor is the core of style .
Of few authors is this more true than of Heidenstam .
The Charles Men has a tremendous range of characters , of common folk even more than of major figures .
The career of Charles 12 , is obviously very similar to that of Napoleon .
His ideal was Alexander of Macedon , as Napoleon's was Julius Caesar .
His purpose , however , was not to establish an empire , but to assert the principle of divine justice .
Each aspired to be a god in human form , but with each it was a different kind of god .
Each failed catastrophically in an invasion of Russia and each brought ruin on the country that worshipped him .
Each is still glorified as a national hero .
For moments he stood in water , shivering and gasping for breath .
He had turned his ankle slightly , and it pained him .
The cars , with their load of howling men , had disappeared in the distance .
There had been two more cars parked at the farm , a Plymouth and a pickup truck .
They would be coming for him next , bearing down on him from both directions .
And then the station wagon and the Ford would seek him out again .
He would be harassed repeatedly and would escape death by inches time after time , all the way to Jarrodsville .
He still had three miles to go .
Back East the more affluent juvenile delinquents , who could afford hyped-up autos instead of switch blades as lethal weapons , played this same game and called it `` Chicken '' .
Hal knew that when that side of Earth rotated into the night zone , Sigmen City would blaze out into space .
And , somewhere in that enormous light , was his apartment .
But Mary would soon no longer be living there , for she would be notified in a few days that her husband had died in an accident while on a flight to Tahiti .
She would weep in private , he was sure , for she loved him in her frigid way , though in public she would be dry-eyed .
Her friends and professional associates would sympathize with her , not because she had lost a beloved husband , but because she had been married to a man who thought unrealistically .
If Hal Yarrow had been killed in a crash , he must have wanted it that way .
There was no such thing as an `` accident '' .
Somehow , all the other passengers ( also supposed to have died in this web of elaborate frauds to cover up the disappearance of the personnel of the Gabriel ) had simultaneously `` agreed '' to die .
And , therefore , being in disgrace , they would not be cremated and their ashes flung to the winds in public ceremony .
No , the fish could eat their bodies for all the Sturch cared .
The Belgians also placed great emphasis on education .
During the 1950s there were as many as 25,000 schools in the Congo .
But almost all the schools were primary .
The average Congolese can do little more than puzzle out the meaning of `` la chatte '' and `` le chien '' and write his name .
Some schools were technical -- the Belgians needed carpenters and mechanics to help exploit the land , and trained many .
But they did not believe in widespread secondary education , much less in college .
It was their conviction that the people should be `` brought up together '' , a grade at a time , until in some indefinite future some might be ready to tackle history , economics and political science .
Indeed , the Belgians discouraged higher education , fearing the creation of a native intellectual elite which might cause unrest .
When the Congo received its independence in 1960 there were , among its 13.5 million people , exactly 14 university graduates .
William Sansom writes only about Europe in this book and frequently of such familiar places as London , Vienna , the French Riviera and the Norwegian fjords .
But no matter what he writes about he brings to his subject his own original mind and his own sensitive reactions .
`` A writer lives , at best , in a state of astonishment '' , he says .
`` Beneath any feeling he has of the good or the evil of the world lies a deeper one of wonder at it all .
To transmit that feeling he writes '' .
This may not be true of many writers , but it certainly is true of Mr. Sansom .
So in these pages one can share his wonder at the traditional fiesta of St. Torpetius that still persists in St. Tropez ; ; at the sun and the heat of Mediterranean lands , always much brighter and hotter to an Englishman than to an American used to summers in New York or Kansas City ; ; at the supreme delights to be found in one of the world's finest restaurants , La Bonne Auberge , which is situated on the seacoast twenty miles west of the Nice airport ; ; and at the infinite variety of London .
Chandler understood this and expected the worst .
But his first few days with Troop H were full of surprises , beginning with First Sergeant Robert Early .
Chandler had expected a tough old trooper with a gravel voice .
Instead Sergeant Early was quiet , sharp and confident .
He had enlisted in the Army straight out of high school and had immediately set about learning his new trade .
There was no weapon Early could not take apart and reassemble blind-folded .
He could lead a patrol and he knew his paper work .
Further , he had taken full advantage of the Army's correspondence courses .
He not only knew soldiering , but mathematics , history and literature as well .
Of course , these works are not comparable , even though the same brain conceived them .
The early works were conceived for a sophisticated , international audience ; ; the later works were conceived to affirm a way of life for fellow citizens .
However , in all of Prokofieff's music , young or mature , we find his profile -- his `` signature '' -- his craftsman's attitude .
Prokofieff never forsakes his medium for the cause of experimentation per se .
In orchestration , he stretches the limits of instrumentation with good judgment and a fine imagination for color .
His sense for rhythmic variety and timing is impeccable .
His creative development of melodic designs of Slavic dance tunes and love songs is captivating : witty , clever , adroit , and subtle .
His counterpoint is pertinent , skillful , and rarely thick .
The motor pool is a completely centralized and mechanized operation .
It handles all types of vehicle maintenance , but concentrates more on `` service station activities '' than on extensive vehicle repairs .
It contracts with outside repair garages for much of the latter work .
Where the pool excels is in its compilation of maintenance and cost-data studies and analyses .
Pool records reveal in detail the cost per mile and miles per gallon of each vehicle , the miles traveled in one year or three years , the periods when vehicle costs become excessive , and when cars should be traded for sound economies .
From this , motor pool personnel develop other meaningful and related data .
In 1959-60 , vehicles averaged an operating cost of $.027 per mile .
Based on this figure and considering depreciation costs of vehicles , pool personnel have determined that travel in excess of 10,000 miles annually is more economical by state car than by payment of allowances for use of personally-owned vehicles .
They estimate further that with sufficient experience and when cost-data of compact cars is compiled , the break-even point may be reduced to 7,500 miles of travel per year .
Table 2 shows operating cost data of state vehicles selected at random .
