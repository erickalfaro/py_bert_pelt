Meredith was irritated when the Grafin knocked at his door and told him , `` She is a great beauty ! !
Shall we allow her not to have a bath ? ?
Actually , she is a sad beauty , I believe .
You shall see her at dinner '' .
Rather erotically he listened to the bath water running ; ; when it stopped he began busily typing , sitting up in a virtuous way .
Before dinner , he shaved for the second time that day .
A thing he did not like doing , generally .
Singing into the mirror and his interested eyes , he was pleased to note , when he stripped for his own bath , that he still had the best part of his Italian sun tan .
He flexed his muscles for several minutes , got into the tub , and then grew self-conscious of splashing as he washed .
Winslow Upton after graduation from Brown University and two years of graduate study , accepted a position at the Harvard Observatory .
For three years he was connected with the U.S.
Naval Observatory and with the U.S. Signal Corps ; ; and after 1883 , was professor of astronomy at Brown University .
The six expeditions to study eclipses of the sun , of which he was a member , took him to Colorado , Virginia , and California as well as to the South Pacific and to Russia .
After her father's death , Lucy and her youngest sister lived for a few years with Winslow in Washington , D.C. . `` Their house '' , writes Albert S. Flint , `` was always a haven of hospitality and good cheer , especially grateful to one like myself far from home '' .
Lucy was a lively part of the household .
Moreover , she had physical as well as mental vigor .
Winslow , as his daughters Eleanor and Margaret recall , used to characterize her as `` our iron sister '' .
There is reason to suppose that Lucy would have made a record as publicly distinguished as her brother had it not been that her mother's death occurred just as she was about to enter college .
As a matter of fact , Albert S. Flint expressed his conviction that `` her physical strength , her mental power , her lively interest in all objects about her and her readiness to serve her fellow beings '' would have led her `` to a distinguished career amongst the noted women of this country '' .
With this act of disobedience , and not with the inception of his individual existence , man began the downward circuit on the spiral of history , descending from the created capacity for immortality to an inescapable mortality .
At the nadir of that circuit is death .
`` Along with the fruit they did also fall under the power of death , because they did eat in disobedience ; ; and disobedience to God entails death .
Wherefore , as they became forfeit to death , from that ( moment ) they were handed over to it '' .
This leads Irenaeus to the somewhat startling notion that Adam and Eve died on the same day that they disobeyed , namely , on a Friday , as a parallel to the death of Christ on Good Friday ; ; he sees a parallel also to the Jewish day of preparation for the Sabbath .
In any case , though they had been promised immortality if they ate of the tree , they obtained mortality instead .
The wages of sin is death .
Man's life , originally shaped for immortality and for communion with God , must now be conformed to the shape of death .
As it turned out , Jessica took matters into her own hands .
Having received permission to give a camp reunion-Halloween party , she asked that I come and be her date .
I went and , mum and nervous , all but made a fool of myself .
Again among those jubilantly reunited bunkmates , I was shy with Jessie and acted as I had during those early Saturday mornings when we all seemed to be playing for effect , to be detached and unconcerned with the girls who were properly our dates but about whom , later , in the privacy of our bunks , we would think in terms of the most elaborate romance .
I remember standing in a corner , watching Jessica act the hostess , serving soft drinks to her guests .
She was wearing her dark hair in two , thick braids to attain an `` American Girl '' effect she thought was appropriate to Halloween .
It made her look sweet and schoolgirlish , I was excited to be with her , but I did not know how to express it .
Yet a moment did come that night when the adventurous letter writer and fantasist seemed to stride off my flashy pages , out of my mind , and plant himself in reality .
It was late , we were playing kissing games , and Jessica and I were called on to kiss in front of the others .
We blushed and were flustered , and it turned out to be the fleetest brush of lips upon cheek .
The kiss outraged our friends but it was done and meanwhile had released in me all the remote , exciting premonitions of lust , all the mysterious sensations that I had imagined a truly consummated kiss would convey to me .
Far more frequently , overeating is the result of a psychological compulsion .
It may be fostered by frustration , depression , insecurity -- or , in children , simply by the desire to stop an anxious mother's nagging .
Some families place undue emphasis on food : conversations center on it , and rich delicacies are offered as rewards , withheld as punishment .
The result says Jolliffe : `` The child gains the feeling that food is the purpose of life '' .
Food may act as a sedative , giving temporary emotional solace , just as , for some people , alcohol does .
Reports Dr. Keys : `` A fairly common experience for us is the wife who finds her husband staying out more and more .
He may be interested in another woman , or just like being with the boys .
So she fishes around in the cupboard and hauls out a chocolate cake .
It's a matter of boredom , and the subconscious feeling that she is entitled to something , because she's being deprived of something else '' .
Foreign policy in its total context With this enlarged role in mind , I should like to make a few suggestions : What we in the United States do or do not do will make a very large difference in what happens in the rest of the world .
We in this Department must think about foreign policy in its total context .
We cannot regard foreign policy as something left over after defense policy or trade policy or fiscal policy has been extracted .
Foreign policy is the total involvement of the American people with peoples and governments abroad .
That means that , if we are to achieve a new standard of leadership , we must think in terms of the total context of our situation .
It is the concern of the Department of State that the American people are safe and secure -- defense is not a monopoly concern of the Department of Defense .
It is also the concern of the Department of State that our trading relationships with the rest of the world are vigorous , profitable , and active -- this is not just a passing interest or a matter of concern only to the Department of Commerce .
We can no longer rely on interdepartmental machinery `` somewhere upstairs '' to resolve differences between this and other departments .
Assistant Secretaries of State will now carry an increased burden of active formulation and coordination of policies .
Means must be found to enable us to keep in touch as regularly and as efficiently as possible with our colleagues in other departments concerned with foreign policy .
But there must be a catalytic pressure .
The military in Taiwan believe that the Communists have made two mistakes , which , together , may prove fatal .
The first was the commune program , which will ensure agricultural poverty for years .
The family is largely broken up ; ; and where it is not , it is left with no residue , and the social meaning of this is enormous .
For it is the family that , in China , has always provided social security for the indigent , the sick , the down-and-out members of the clan .
Now the government must do that ; ; but the government is left with no reserve granary , under the agricultural system it has ordained .
Thus the government simultaneously undertook the vast burden of social security which had traditionally been privately discharged , and created a national scarcity which has engendered calamitous problems of social security .
Hal knew that when that side of Earth rotated into the night zone , Sigmen City would blaze out into space .
And , somewhere in that enormous light , was his apartment .
But Mary would soon no longer be living there , for she would be notified in a few days that her husband had died in an accident while on a flight to Tahiti .
She would weep in private , he was sure , for she loved him in her frigid way , though in public she would be dry-eyed .
Her friends and professional associates would sympathize with her , not because she had lost a beloved husband , but because she had been married to a man who thought unrealistically .
If Hal Yarrow had been killed in a crash , he must have wanted it that way .
There was no such thing as an `` accident '' .
Somehow , all the other passengers ( also supposed to have died in this web of elaborate frauds to cover up the disappearance of the personnel of the Gabriel ) had simultaneously `` agreed '' to die .
And , therefore , being in disgrace , they would not be cremated and their ashes flung to the winds in public ceremony .
No , the fish could eat their bodies for all the Sturch cared .
Heidenstam wrote four other works of fiction about earlier figures revered in Swedish memory .
Excellent in their way , they lack the wide appeal of The Charles Men , and need not detain us here .
It is different with his volume The Swedes And Their Chieftains ( Svenskarna och deras Hovdingar ) , a history intended for the general reader and particularly suited for high school students .
Admirably written , it is a perfect introduction to Swedish history for readers of other countries .
Some of the earlier episodes have touches of the supernatural , as suited to the legendary background .
These are suggestive of Selma Lagerlof .
Especially touching is the chapter , `` The Little Sister '' , about a king's daughter who became a nun in the convent of St. Birgitta .
The record teems with romance and adventure .
Gustaf Vasa is a superb example , and Charles 10 , , the conqueror of Denmark , hardly less so .
Of Gustavus Adolphus and Charles 12 , it is unnecessary to speak .
A concentration distribution has been derived from radar observations sensitive to the fifteenth magnitude ( Manning and Eshleman , 1959 ) .
Extrapolation of this relationship through the thirtieth magnitude covers the range of micrometeorites .
The approximate equation is Af , where N is the number of Af with electron line-density greater than or equal to Af , and Q is proportional to the mass of the meteorite .
Therefore , N is inversely proportional to the radius cubed and in fair agreement with the inverse 7/2 power derived from 1958 Alpha and 1959 Eta data .
At the fifteenth magnitude , Af , and at the twenty-fifth magnitude , Af .
These extrapolated fluxes are about an order of magnitude less than the values from the satellite data and the figures in Whipple's table .
The extrapolation may be in error for several reasons .
The observational data determining the concentration distribution have a range of error which is magnified in the extension into the micrometeorite region .
The solar-electromagnetic- and corpuscular-radiation pressure and the associated Poynting-Robertson effect increase in effectiveness as the particle size decreases and modify the distribution and limit sizes to larger than a few microns .
Also , it has been suggested that the source of all or part of the dust may not be the same as that for visual or radar meteorites ( Best , 1960 ) , and the same distribution would not be expected .
