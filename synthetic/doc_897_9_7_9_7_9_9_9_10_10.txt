Far more frequently , overeating is the result of a psychological compulsion .
It may be fostered by frustration , depression , insecurity -- or , in children , simply by the desire to stop an anxious mother's nagging .
Some families place undue emphasis on food : conversations center on it , and rich delicacies are offered as rewards , withheld as punishment .
The result says Jolliffe : `` The child gains the feeling that food is the purpose of life '' .
Food may act as a sedative , giving temporary emotional solace , just as , for some people , alcohol does .
Reports Dr. Keys : `` A fairly common experience for us is the wife who finds her husband staying out more and more .
He may be interested in another woman , or just like being with the boys .
So she fishes around in the cupboard and hauls out a chocolate cake .
It's a matter of boredom , and the subconscious feeling that she is entitled to something , because she's being deprived of something else '' .
But there must be a catalytic pressure .
The military in Taiwan believe that the Communists have made two mistakes , which , together , may prove fatal .
The first was the commune program , which will ensure agricultural poverty for years .
The family is largely broken up ; ; and where it is not , it is left with no residue , and the social meaning of this is enormous .
For it is the family that , in China , has always provided social security for the indigent , the sick , the down-and-out members of the clan .
Now the government must do that ; ; but the government is left with no reserve granary , under the agricultural system it has ordained .
Thus the government simultaneously undertook the vast burden of social security which had traditionally been privately discharged , and created a national scarcity which has engendered calamitous problems of social security .
The Belgians also placed great emphasis on education .
During the 1950s there were as many as 25,000 schools in the Congo .
But almost all the schools were primary .
The average Congolese can do little more than puzzle out the meaning of `` la chatte '' and `` le chien '' and write his name .
Some schools were technical -- the Belgians needed carpenters and mechanics to help exploit the land , and trained many .
But they did not believe in widespread secondary education , much less in college .
It was their conviction that the people should be `` brought up together '' , a grade at a time , until in some indefinite future some might be ready to tackle history , economics and political science .
Indeed , the Belgians discouraged higher education , fearing the creation of a native intellectual elite which might cause unrest .
When the Congo received its independence in 1960 there were , among its 13.5 million people , exactly 14 university graduates .
In all the respects just indicated Utopian communism differs from previous conceptions in which community of possessions and living plays a role .
Neither from one of these conceptions nor from a combination of them can it be deduced .
We do not deny originality to the Agamemnon because Aeschylus found the tales of the house of Atreus among the folk lore of the Greeks .
In a like sense whatever bits or shreds of previous conceptions one may find in it , Utopian communism remains , as an integral whole , original -- a new thing .
It is not merely a new thing ; ; it is one of the very few new things in Utopia ; ; most of the rest is medieval or humanist or part of an old tradition of social criticism .
But to say that at a moment in history something is new is not necessarily to say that it is modern ; ; and for this statement the best evidence comes within the five years following the publication of Utopia , when Martin Luther elaborates a new perception of the nature of the Divine's encounter with man .
New , indeed , is Luther's perception , but not modern , as anyone knows who has ever tried to make intelligible to modern students what Luther was getting at .
A high-speed shutter has been developed in order to permit photographic observation of any portion of the electrical wire explosion .
The shutter consists of two parts : a fast-opening part and a fast-closing part .
Using Edgerton's method , the fast-closing action is obtained from the blackening of a window by exploding a series of parallel lead wires .
The fast-opening of the shutter consists of a piece of aluminum foil ( approximately Af ) placed directly in front of the camera lens so that no light may pass into the camera .
The opening action is obtained when a capacitor , charged to high voltage , is suddenly discharged through the foil .
During the discharge the magnetic forces set up by the passage of current cause the edges of the foil to roll inward toward its center line , thus allowing light to pass into the camera .
Experiments have shown that the shutter is 75 percent open in about 60-80 microseconds .
The shutter aperture may be made larger or smaller by changing the foil area and adjusting the electrical energy input to the foil .

As you've doubtless forgotten the circumstances in the press of more recent depredations , permit me to recapitulate them briefly .
Sometime on Saturday evening , August 22nd , while my family and I were dining at the Hostaria dell' Orso , in Rome , you jimmied a window of our home in Bucks County , Pennsylvania , and let yourselves into the premises .
Hastening to the attic , the temperature of which was easily hotter than the Gold Coast , you proceeded to mask the windows with a fancy wool coverlet , some khaki pants , and the like , and to ransack the innumerable boxes and barrels stored there .
What you were looking for ( unless you make a hobby of collecting old tennis rackets and fly screens ) eludes me , but to judge from phonograph records scattered about a fumed-oak Victrola .
You danced two tangos and a paso doble , which must have been fairly enervating in that milieu .
You then descended one story , glommed a television set from the music room -- the only constructive feature of your visit , by the way -- and , returning to the ground floor , entered the master bedroom .
From the curio cabinet on its south wall and the bureaus beneath , you abstracted seventeen ivory , metal , wood , and stone sculptures of Oriental and African origin , two snuffboxes , and a jade-handled magnifying glass .
Rummaging through a stack of drawers nearby , you unearthed an antique French chess set in ivory and sandalwood , which , along with two box Kodaks , you added to your haul .
Then , having wrapped the lot in an afghan my dog customarily slept on , you lammed out the front door , considerately leaving it open for neighbors to discover .
She brought up her free hand to hit him , but this time he was quicker .
He side-stepped her blow and she fell , stumbling against the gelding .
She finally regained her balance and got up in the saddle .
Her hat had come off and fallen behind her shoulders , held by the string , and he could see her face more clearly than he had at any time before .
He had forgotten that she was so pretty .
But her prettiness was what he had noticed first , and all the other things had come afterward : cruelty , meanness , self-will .
He had known women like that , one woman in particular .
And one had been too many .
He watched the girl until she had gone into the trees , and waited until he couldn't hear the sound of her horse any longer , then went up to where the children were sleeping .
Winslow Upton after graduation from Brown University and two years of graduate study , accepted a position at the Harvard Observatory .
For three years he was connected with the U.S.
Naval Observatory and with the U.S. Signal Corps ; ; and after 1883 , was professor of astronomy at Brown University .
The six expeditions to study eclipses of the sun , of which he was a member , took him to Colorado , Virginia , and California as well as to the South Pacific and to Russia .
After her father's death , Lucy and her youngest sister lived for a few years with Winslow in Washington , D.C. . `` Their house '' , writes Albert S. Flint , `` was always a haven of hospitality and good cheer , especially grateful to one like myself far from home '' .
Lucy was a lively part of the household .
Moreover , she had physical as well as mental vigor .
Winslow , as his daughters Eleanor and Margaret recall , used to characterize her as `` our iron sister '' .
There is reason to suppose that Lucy would have made a record as publicly distinguished as her brother had it not been that her mother's death occurred just as she was about to enter college .
As a matter of fact , Albert S. Flint expressed his conviction that `` her physical strength , her mental power , her lively interest in all objects about her and her readiness to serve her fellow beings '' would have led her `` to a distinguished career amongst the noted women of this country '' .
Now let us imagine a wing of B-52's , on alert near their `` positive control ( or fail-safe ) points '' , the spots on the map , many miles from Soviet territory , beyond which they are forbidden to fly without specific orders to proceed to their targets .
They , too , have fragments of the go code with them .
As Wisman put it , `` They have separate pieces of the pie , and we have the whole pie .
Once we send out the whole pie , they can put their pieces into it .
Unless we send out the whole pie , their pieces mean nothing '' .
Why does Wisman's ever-changing code always mesh with the fragments in possession of the button pushers ? ?
The answer is a cryptographic secret .
At any rate , three men out of a six-man B-52 crew are required to copy down Wisman's go-to-war message .
Each must match Wisman's `` pie '' with the fragment that he carries with him .
All three must compare notes and agree to `` go '' .
