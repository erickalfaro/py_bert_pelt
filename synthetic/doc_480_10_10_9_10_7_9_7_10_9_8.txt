To release clay from mold , place hands in a cupped position around project ; ; gently lift the edge on far side , then continue to release edge completely around mold .
Slight tapping on the underside of mold will help release the clay , but too much agitation will cause the clay to become soft and will interfere with removal of clay from mold .
Place a piece of plaster wall board or plaster bat on clay and reverse bat , clay and mold in one action .
This will prevent the clay from twisting or bending , causing warping when fired .
Place project on table and carefully lift the mold off .
Study surface of clay for defects or desired corrections .
If clay is slightly out of shape , square straight sides with guide sticks or rulers pressed against opposite sides , or smooth round pieces with damp fingers .
If the background of design is too smooth , or you wish to create a wood-grained effect , it may be added at this time with a dull tool such as the handle of a fine paintbrush .
Make slight , smooth grooves rather than cuts for the texture ( cuts could cause air pockets under the glaze creating pinholes or craters in the glaze during firing ) .
Leave the clay on plaster board to dry slowly , covered lightly with a loose piece of plastic or cloth to prevent warping .
Several of the replies to Mr. Toynbee , without conscious resort to the traditional terminology with regard to the permission of evil , succeed in restoring the actual context in which present moral and political decisions must be made , by distinguishing between choosing a great evil and choosing in danger of this evil .
`` It is worse for a nation to give in to evil than to run the risk of annihilation '' .
`` I am consciously prepared to run the continued risk of ' race suicide by accident ' rather than accept the alternative certainty of race slavery by design .
But I can only make this choice because I believe that the risk need not increase , but may be deliberately reduced '' ( by precautions against accidents or by limiting war ? ? )
`` Quoting Mr. Kennan's phrase that anything would be better than a policy which led inevitably to nuclear war , he ( Toynbee ) says that anything is better than a policy which allows for the possibility of nuclear war '' .
`` If asked to choose between a terrible probability and a more terrible possibility , most men will choose the latter '' .
`` If Philip Toynbee is claiming that the choice lies between capitulation and the risk of nuclear war , I think he is right .
I do not accept that the choice is between capitulation and the certainty of nuclear war '' .
Even Professor Arnold Toynbee , agreeing with his son , does so in these terms : `` Compared to continuing to incur a constant risk of the destruction of the human race , all other evils are lesser evils .
Let us therefore put first things first , and make sure of preserving the human race at whatever the temporary price may be '' .
A young man appeared out of a side alley and walked toward us with quick strides .
He wore a long double-breasted coat of a heavy material , dark trousers , and black boots with buckles .
His black hat with its wide brim , high crown , and fur trim rode high .
With his head erect , he approached , not glancing at us , and passed by with his clear eyes raised and fixed straight ahead .
He had a pinkish-white complexion , a small straight nose , a short black beard , and tightly curled paot .
I was suddenly conscious of my bare arms .
The girls in the market place wore long-sleeved dresses and covered their legs with cloth stockings .
I turned and watched him stride down the center of the road .
His hands were swinging at his sides , and he passed through the dingy market place with his back straight and , pivoting on his heel , he entered an old stone building .
Anti-A and anti-B activities were determined in fractions from the sera of group A , group B or group O donors by the following tube agglutination methods .
One drop of each sample was added to one drop of a 2% suspension of group Af or group B red cells in a small Af test tube .
In several instances group O cells were also used as controls .
The red cells were used within 2 days after donation and were washed with large amounts of saline before use .
The mixtures of sample plus cell suspension were allowed to stand at room temperature for 1 Aj .
The tubes were then centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 1 min and examined macroscopically for agglutination .
For the albumin method , equal volumes of 30% bovine albumin , sample and 2% cells suspended in saline were allowed to stand at room temperature for 1 hr and then were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 1 Aj .
All samples were tested by both the saline and albumin methods .
The activities of fractions of sera containing Rh antibodies were tested by the saline , albumin and indirect Coombs techniques .
Homozygous and heterozygous Af cells , Af and homozygous and heterozygous Af cells were used to test each sample ; ; however , in the interest of clarity and conciseness only the results obtained with homozygous Af and homozygous Af cells will be presented here .
Since then , the flowers she had planted had spread all over the hill .
Already the jonquils were blooming in a flock by the front gate , and the periwinkles were coming on , blue by the porch steps .
In a week the hyacinths would spike out .
And the dogwood in early May , for Miss Ada's alfresco party ; ; and after that the Japanese cherries .
Now the yard looked wet and bald , the trees bare under their buds , but in a while Miss Ada's flowers would bloom like a marching parade .
She had dug a hole for each bulb , each tree wore a tag with her writing on it ; ; where would she go for her gardening now ? ?
Somehow Winston didn't think she'd take to window boxes .
By then Hez could see for himself , and so could the others .
Soon they were all shouting greetings , exchanging smiles , and rejoicing to think that they were all back together again .
But even a reunion as joyous as this one did not make a break in the routines of the day .
Nor could they stop and find out about all that had happened until they made circle , tended the cattle , tethered the horses , gathered fuel , carried water , and started their cooking fires .
Then , and only then , with the Jacksons and Dan as their true guests of honor , did the Harrows take time to catch up on the news .
No sooner did they hear of Dan's injury than both Gran and Matilda went into immediate action .
The wound in his scalp was examined , pronounced healing , and well doctored with simples , before they dished up the victuals .
From then on , in keeping with the traditions they had followed since childhood , the whole group settled down to relish their food .
Even Sally , in spite of her gaiety and obvious welcome , followed the old taboo of `` quitting the gab when wearing the nosebag '' .
But there must be a catalytic pressure .
The military in Taiwan believe that the Communists have made two mistakes , which , together , may prove fatal .
The first was the commune program , which will ensure agricultural poverty for years .
The family is largely broken up ; ; and where it is not , it is left with no residue , and the social meaning of this is enormous .
For it is the family that , in China , has always provided social security for the indigent , the sick , the down-and-out members of the clan .
Now the government must do that ; ; but the government is left with no reserve granary , under the agricultural system it has ordained .
Thus the government simultaneously undertook the vast burden of social security which had traditionally been privately discharged , and created a national scarcity which has engendered calamitous problems of social security .
During the quarrel I learned what the trouble was , from the accusations each hurled at the other .
The Beech Pasture had suddenly become valuable .
There's a fine granite quarry there , and granite's coming back for public buildings .
Both men knew it was in the Norberg family holdings , but to which of the cousins did it belong , Anta or Freya ? ?
Fortunately , I knew almost exactly what the will had said .
It began with a preamble , of course .
This explained that the judge of probate of Essex County , 1785 or 1786 , appointed three free-holders of Gloucester to divide and establish the Norberg estate .
After the usual Honorable Sirs , it went on to say that there had been set off to the widow one full third part of the real estate of the deceased Salu Norberg , one lower room , on the Western side , privileges to the well and bake-oven and to one third of the cellar ( I can show you the cellar when we go up ) , also one Cow Right , and lastly they set off to the widow her own land that she brought with her as dower , namely the Beech Pasture .
And I remember that the whole of the privileges , not counting the Beech Pasture , was valued at twenty pounds .
I wish you could have seen the crests fall on these two sparring coxcombs when I told them that obviously the pasture belonged to their wives jointly .
A high-speed shutter has been developed in order to permit photographic observation of any portion of the electrical wire explosion .
The shutter consists of two parts : a fast-opening part and a fast-closing part .
Using Edgerton's method , the fast-closing action is obtained from the blackening of a window by exploding a series of parallel lead wires .
The fast-opening of the shutter consists of a piece of aluminum foil ( approximately Af ) placed directly in front of the camera lens so that no light may pass into the camera .
The opening action is obtained when a capacitor , charged to high voltage , is suddenly discharged through the foil .
During the discharge the magnetic forces set up by the passage of current cause the edges of the foil to roll inward toward its center line , thus allowing light to pass into the camera .
Experiments have shown that the shutter is 75 percent open in about 60-80 microseconds .
The shutter aperture may be made larger or smaller by changing the foil area and adjusting the electrical energy input to the foil .

After five minutes with Blanche , one might welcome the astringency of Grazie , who was a sort of Gwen Cafritz to Francesca's Perle Mesta .
Francesca and Grazie were habitual committee chairmen and they usually managed to be elected co-chairmen , equal bosses , of whatever PTA or civic project was being launched .
They were inseparable , not because they were fond of each other , but because they wanted to keep an eye on each other , as they were keen rivals for social leadership .
Grazie was mean : quietly mean , and bitterly , unfunnily sarcastic .
She it was who had looked to see if I was wearing shoes upon learning that I couldn't drive .
Grazie had a small , slick head and her hair and skin were the color of golden toast .
She lived in an ultra-modern house whose decoration , appointments , paint , and even pets were chosen to complement her coloring ; ; the pets were a couple of Siamese cats .
Her uniform was of rich , raw silk , in a shade which matched her hair , skin , housepaint , and cats , and since she was so thin as to be almost shapeless , she rather resembled a frozen fish stick .
