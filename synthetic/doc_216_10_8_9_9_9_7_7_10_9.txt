Once the principle was established , the increase in state-owned vehicles came rapidly .
And reasons other than employee need contributed to the growth .
Table 1 immediately below shows the rate of growth of vehicles and employees .
This rate of increase does not signify anything in itself .
It does not indicate loose management , ineffective controls or poor policy .
But it does show that automobiles have increased steadily over the years and in almost the same proportion to the increase of state employees .
In the past twenty years the ratio of state-owned automobiles per state employees has varied from 1 to 22 then to 1 to 23 now .
Whether there were too few automobiles in 1940 or too many now is problematical .
The fact is simply that state-owned vehicles have remained in practically the same proportion as employees to use them .
History and operation of the motor pool .
The average reader of this magazine owns more than one gun ( we ran a survey to find out ) but he's always on the lookout for new and better arms .
He's more than a reader of outdoor articles ; ; he's a real hunter and shooter , eager to improve his sport .
Well , if you're that kind of sportsman we're here to help you .
You've probably given a lot of Christmas-season thought to the guns in your rack , but it's not easy to decide on a new one .
You still have time to drop a few hints about the gifts you'd appreciate most ; ; the time to decide on them is now .
As a Christmas service , I've taken a close look at this year's crop of new models .
Here they are , with my comments and judgments .
Read on , take your pick -- and start dropping those hints .
In most discussions of this phenomenon , the figures are substantially inflated .
No suburban shopping-center branch -- not even Hudson's vast Northland outside Detroit -- does anything like the unit volume of business or carries anything like the variety of merchandise to be found in the home store .
Telephone orders distort the picture : the suburbanite naturally calls a local rather than a central-city number if both are listed in an advertisement , especially if the local call eliminates city sales tax .
The suburban branch is thereby credited with a sale which would have been made even if its glass doors had never opened .
Accounting procedures which continue to charge a disproportionate overhead and warehouse expense to the main store make the branches seem more profitable than they are .
In many cases that statement -- `` We break even on our downtown operation and make money on our branches '' -- would be turned around if the cost analysis were recalculated on terms less prejudicial to the old store .
Fear of the competition -- always a great motivating force in the American economy -- makes retailers who do not have suburban operations exaggerate both the volume and the profitability of their rival's shiny new branches .
The fact seems to be that very many large branch stores are uneconomical , that the choice of location in the suburbs is as important as it was downtown , and that even highly suburbanized cities will support only so many big branches .
Moreover , the cost of operations is always high in any new store , as the conservative bankers who act as controllers for retail giants are beginning to discover .
Far more frequently , overeating is the result of a psychological compulsion .
It may be fostered by frustration , depression , insecurity -- or , in children , simply by the desire to stop an anxious mother's nagging .
Some families place undue emphasis on food : conversations center on it , and rich delicacies are offered as rewards , withheld as punishment .
The result says Jolliffe : `` The child gains the feeling that food is the purpose of life '' .
Food may act as a sedative , giving temporary emotional solace , just as , for some people , alcohol does .
Reports Dr. Keys : `` A fairly common experience for us is the wife who finds her husband staying out more and more .
He may be interested in another woman , or just like being with the boys .
So she fishes around in the cupboard and hauls out a chocolate cake .
It's a matter of boredom , and the subconscious feeling that she is entitled to something , because she's being deprived of something else '' .
She brought up her free hand to hit him , but this time he was quicker .
He side-stepped her blow and she fell , stumbling against the gelding .
She finally regained her balance and got up in the saddle .
Her hat had come off and fallen behind her shoulders , held by the string , and he could see her face more clearly than he had at any time before .
He had forgotten that she was so pretty .
But her prettiness was what he had noticed first , and all the other things had come afterward : cruelty , meanness , self-will .
He had known women like that , one woman in particular .
And one had been too many .
He watched the girl until she had gone into the trees , and waited until he couldn't hear the sound of her horse any longer , then went up to where the children were sleeping .
Since then , the flowers she had planted had spread all over the hill .
Already the jonquils were blooming in a flock by the front gate , and the periwinkles were coming on , blue by the porch steps .
In a week the hyacinths would spike out .
And the dogwood in early May , for Miss Ada's alfresco party ; ; and after that the Japanese cherries .
Now the yard looked wet and bald , the trees bare under their buds , but in a while Miss Ada's flowers would bloom like a marching parade .
She had dug a hole for each bulb , each tree wore a tag with her writing on it ; ; where would she go for her gardening now ? ?
Somehow Winston didn't think she'd take to window boxes .
But there must be a catalytic pressure .
The military in Taiwan believe that the Communists have made two mistakes , which , together , may prove fatal .
The first was the commune program , which will ensure agricultural poverty for years .
The family is largely broken up ; ; and where it is not , it is left with no residue , and the social meaning of this is enormous .
For it is the family that , in China , has always provided social security for the indigent , the sick , the down-and-out members of the clan .
Now the government must do that ; ; but the government is left with no reserve granary , under the agricultural system it has ordained .
Thus the government simultaneously undertook the vast burden of social security which had traditionally been privately discharged , and created a national scarcity which has engendered calamitous problems of social security .
Hal knew that when that side of Earth rotated into the night zone , Sigmen City would blaze out into space .
And , somewhere in that enormous light , was his apartment .
But Mary would soon no longer be living there , for she would be notified in a few days that her husband had died in an accident while on a flight to Tahiti .
She would weep in private , he was sure , for she loved him in her frigid way , though in public she would be dry-eyed .
Her friends and professional associates would sympathize with her , not because she had lost a beloved husband , but because she had been married to a man who thought unrealistically .
If Hal Yarrow had been killed in a crash , he must have wanted it that way .
There was no such thing as an `` accident '' .
Somehow , all the other passengers ( also supposed to have died in this web of elaborate frauds to cover up the disappearance of the personnel of the Gabriel ) had simultaneously `` agreed '' to die .
And , therefore , being in disgrace , they would not be cremated and their ashes flung to the winds in public ceremony .
No , the fish could eat their bodies for all the Sturch cared .
The Belgians also placed great emphasis on education .
During the 1950s there were as many as 25,000 schools in the Congo .
But almost all the schools were primary .
The average Congolese can do little more than puzzle out the meaning of `` la chatte '' and `` le chien '' and write his name .
Some schools were technical -- the Belgians needed carpenters and mechanics to help exploit the land , and trained many .
But they did not believe in widespread secondary education , much less in college .
It was their conviction that the people should be `` brought up together '' , a grade at a time , until in some indefinite future some might be ready to tackle history , economics and political science .
Indeed , the Belgians discouraged higher education , fearing the creation of a native intellectual elite which might cause unrest .
When the Congo received its independence in 1960 there were , among its 13.5 million people , exactly 14 university graduates .
